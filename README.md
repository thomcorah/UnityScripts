Some useful Unity scripts

A quick guide to each of these.


## Avatar.cs  

This script provides simple mouse and keyboard control of our avatar object.

## MoveDown.cs

This very simply moves the object down at a constant rate.

## SmallRandomMovement.cs

Creates a small random back-and-forth movement of about 2deg in a direction perpendicular to the direction to the player. This is done in order to increase the authenticity of binaurally rendered sounds, where a random movement of 2deg in the sound source has been shown to reduce the rate of front/back errors.
